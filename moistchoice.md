**AFTER** much discussion, and consultation with teams going through similar issues (ie, everyone) we’re looking to implement systems to help reframe the conversation.  The big issue we’ve seen lately is the Stats vs Lore conflict, which has felt intractable.  But what if we replaced that “vs” with an “and”?  If we don’t consider Stats and Lore to be opposed values, but instead independent variables, we can change conversation from a faction-based referendum to a nuanced conversation.

“Stats” and “Lore” don’t fully encompass all that we mean when we talk about voting, so we’ll need to come up with some new vocabulary to better express things.  For the purposes of example (more on this later) let’s use the following terms:

> **Head** = Prioritize lineup / rotation efficiency, Improve the team while minimizing risk, Pursue strategies to exploit untapped potential, Strategically “tank” when necessary, etc.

> **Heart** = Prioritize player attachment, Explore fun or funny options, Embrace the inevitability of chaos & calamity, etc.

**Note that these terms are not in conflict with each other.**  That’s intentional!  Just as you couldn’t live without a head *or* a heart, our community couldn’t be as vibrant as it is without the values contained within both of these categories.  Every decision we make can be measured in terms of value to each, rather than being evaluated on one side or the other—some decisions are high Head and high Heart!  And not everyone will agree on exactly where a decision falls within a category, so debate will be needed to clarify a community position, or at least present a spectrum of possibilities.

With those terms in mind, let’s explore a hypothetical conversation around a recent debate: the Equivalent Exchange of Alston Cerveza.  Remember that at the time we were fairly certain we would lose Alston anyway, so the *EE* itself was fairly uncontroversial.  After the release of a chart outlining the “best” players (stat-wise) in range of Alston, the following conversation might have taken place:


> **Moist Talker A:**  Jessica Telephone is clearly the pick.  She’s got the best stats, so she’s high Head, and she’s a great and beloved character, so she’s high Heart.  Win-win!

> **Moist Talker B:**  I disagree.  While the stats are good, she’s very likely to be plundered very quickly — even during the same election after we take her!  To me that makes her low or medium, at best, in both Head and Heart.

> **Moist Talker C:**  What about Hercules Alighieri or Gerund Pantheocide?  They are both very good, slightly below JT in stats, but less established and less likely to be plundered.  I think that would still be high Head, and at least medium Heart with a chance to grow over time.

> **Moist Talker A:**  I could see that.  They’re still pretty much high Head, which is my priority.

> **Moist Talker B:**  Hm.  I see it, but I don’t like taking from the Lift, making Gerund low Heart for me.  I do like picking on the Georgias, making Hercules very high Heart!

> **Moist Talker D:**  Speaking of high Heart...did anyone see Richmond is on this list?  I don’t think there’s any higher Heart choice!  YIPPEE!  BEST FRIEND!

> **Moist Talker B:**  Well I’d like Richmond to collect more hats before he comes home, so I don’t know about highest Heart choice, but...Richmond Harrison is my best friend, so yeah that’s high Heart, I’ll give you that.

> **Moist Talker A:**  Seriously?  We can’t just pick on Heart.

> **Moist Talker C:**  True, but he’s on the list, so he’s at least medium Head!


Note how that conversation embraces a spectrum of opinions across both variables and avoids making right / wrong judgments about any specific move, while still moving us towards “high” values and away from “low” values.  It’s actually kind of a distilled version of the debate we actually had!  That debate wasn’t so sticky in the end, and the nuance involved helped a lot.  If we apply that nuance, in this codified form, to future debates, we believe we can avoid many of the bitter “us vs them” arguments we’ve been seeing lately.

Later in the week, we’ll consolidate proposals made by our community into a widely accessible forum that acknowledges the range of arguments we’ve heard in each category in a condensed way, such as in **[a document like this one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2URGH8f37fcpFcqyrdPQqm0srjjgXTjgugsnm_44KE/edit)**.  This can be used as a general guide for coordinated voting — as always, you’re encouraged to think for yourself and vote for your favorite choice, but remember that we are strong and effective together!

***BUT***, here’s the kicker: we haven’t been able to come up with a definitive set of terms yet, so we need some help from all of you.  “Head and Heart” are good, but we want it to be a distinctly Moist Talker set of values — things distinct, not in conflict, that we couldn’t live without.  **[So sound off on what you think those should be](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFKE-7l1YDO2m3IBSzrOiTrOQwwDpL31IxOT9XzQ9hUNJ8AA/viewform)**: either from our ideas, or propose your own!
