# Canada Moist Talker Rules
We have 2 Community Values. 
> 1. Be Kind and 
> 2. Be Gross

## Team Structure
Each team on discord has their own way of managing things.  We have permanent residence representatives. Team Representatives (often ‚Äúreps‚Äù for short) fulfil the following roles:
* Being a point of contact representing the Team, for Keepers & Other Teams
* Custodial responsibilities, such as pinning, posting news
* Organizing Group Voting
* Deleting inappropriate posts on the spot
* Summoning the Keepers

If you have a problem with a Representatives, or any other discord user, utilize mod mail by DM-ing: 
```
!MODMAIL_KEEPERSüìÆ#0864 
````
Your Active Representatives are `pigeons#2351`, `Sera#3684`, `Zakaro#5951`, `thevdude#6881`, `Paranundrox#6397` & `Squeeq#5185`.

Our four channels are:
* **#üì∞the-daily-spews** a news/announcement board channel
* **#orb-corner** or whatever joke its renamed for, general channel
* **#gleek-seating** channel for live watching games
* **#moist-glallery** an archival art channel

## #üì∞The-Daily-Spews
Our news channel. Make sure to read to keep up with current events & team organization.
### Temperature Checks
Sometimes the representatives will do quick temperature checks in **#üì∞the-daily-spews** to get a feel for general team vibes on a topic. Results of temperature checks are not set in stone, but they help representatives make snap decisions, such as e.g. temporarily closing our channels after a player is incinerated.
## #Moist-Glallery
A channel dedicated to art & creative content only.
* Post Creative content **#moisttalkers-glallery**. Don't be afraid to post it in the main channel as well, this channel exist for Archival purposes. Tag your art so people can search the channel more easily, e.g. [Richmond] or [Ziwa & Eugenia].
* No chatter in **#moisttalkers-glallery**, the other we have two other channels for people talking moistly. Artists, feel free to post art in **#moisttalkers-glallery** & the main channel so people can gush over it there. Incidental chatter will be deleted by the representatives.
* WIPs & Sketches live in **#moisttalkers-glallery** too! Please post your sketches you might not necessarily be confident to post in **#fanwork** in **#moisttalkers-glallery**, we think they are beautiful and still want to see them. However try to refrain from spamming WIPs, if you want show us every step of the process maybe make a process GIF/video!

## Pausing Topics ‚è∏
üöß[Under construction]üöß

Sometimes the team representatives will ask for moratorium or ‚Äúpause‚Äù on certain topics. Usually this is when something catastrophic has happened to the team and we can‚Äôt deal with voting discourse & incineration grief happening simultaneously.

## Voting
Every team has a slightly different approach to organised voting. Ours can be summarized as ‚Äúcurated democracy‚Äù. We encourage people to vote with their hearts, as long as they *record their votes in the sheet* üëÅ‚úç
If a conversation about voting becomes too circular or heated, the representatives will shut it down.

### The Sheet
All our voting is recorded & coordinated in a google sheet. You can find the sheet by posting `+moistvotes` in **#orb-corner**. One of the most important parts of the sheet is the *blessing/decrees preference* section. It gives everyone a chance to voice their opinions without the topic of voting dominating chat.
### Curated Democracy
If there is a clear leader in the *blessing/decrees* preference section, we‚Äôll begin propaganda for that option so we can communicate to the discord-external community (usually via twitter). Otherwise, representatives will use the general consensus from *blessing/decrees preference* section to set voting goals on the *Blessing Vote Entry* page. There members who wish to engage in team coordination can find out where to vote. Even if you don‚Äôt vote for a voting goal, please record your votes.
### Wills
So far our current system has worked well, up until Season 12 where Wills were introduced.  Wills are far more divisive & higher permutation than blessings & decrees. Our main rule for Wills is **DON‚ÄôT VOTE UNTIL SATURDAY**. Voting before Saturday can lead to cases of accidental necromancy, or infusing a player now no longer on our team. Wills are only ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to vote on after post-season has ended, when players can no longer be affected by events. 

The team representatives are still figuring out how to handle Wills-course, please bear with us.
## Content Warnings & Cursed Content
You can spoiler text by with the  following formatting:

`|| Spoiler Text ||`

If you are on mobile, the Blaseball Discord has a bot that lets you spoiler images by starting your message with: 

`-spoiler`

Make sure to spoiler text & images appropriately, and always let people know what you are issuing a warning about. For example: *cw: eyes*
### Cursed Content
Moist Talkers have a reputation for being into cursed content. Here's some guidelines so cursed content can be a safe time for everyone.
* Cursed Content that has body horror & hyper fixation on specific body parts should be spoilered, and have an appropriate Content Warning applied.
* No violent or gorey imagery.
* Nothing NSFW/NSFL, this is a PG-13 server.

### Food Crimes
Moist Talkers are the #1 exporter of food crimes, until the Wild Wings Legal Dept. sues us for this claim. If you ever need a refresher on food crime rules, or how to spoiler things in general, use the `+foodcrimes` command in chat.
* Spoiler your images of food in general, and let people know there's food content underneath with a Content Warning. Either cw: food or cw: food crime
* Food crimes that are food being mixed, combined or used in unconventional ways? good ‚úÖ
* Food crimes that are unhygienic, off or spoiled, has something growing on it? bad üö´
## Propaganda
Propaganda is images related to voting, teams & events posted in **#community-billboard**.
* DO NOT appropriate IRL facist/bigoted propaganda/imagery for your propaganda.
* If your propaganda involves another team, get a temperature check from others in our channel if it seems appropriate.
* If you use another person‚Äôs art in your propaganda, make sure to credit the artist.
* If your propaganda is a direct edit of another person‚Äôs work ask that person for permission before posting.

## Misc.
### Pronouns
You are not obliged to put your pronouns in your name, but it makes discord a more welcoming space for those who require to do so.
###  Visitors
Our teams policy to visitors by default is `Open‚úÖ`. You can check other teams‚Äô visiting policies here: https://teams.beefox.xyz/
### Sundaesüç®
* Sundaes are a legit way to play the game that is Blaseball. Don‚Äôt criticize/moralize other team members for using them.
* Conversely, do not do a song & dance about your payouts for Sundaes. Remember, Be Kind.
### Swoomba
The Swoomba is a bot that deletes swear words. We have a couple of extra words that it considers ‚Äúnaughty words‚Äù in our channel. If your message gets randomly deleted for mentioning a certain webcomic, that‚Äôs why.
