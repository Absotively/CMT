<h1 class="western">Team Structure</h1>
<p>Each team on discord has their own way of managing things.  We
have permanent residence representatives. Team Representatives (often
&ldquo;reps&rdquo; for short) fulfil the following roles:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Being a point of contact representing the Team, for Keepers &amp;
	Other Teams<!-- Need to a better way to word this. --></p>
	<li><p>Custodial responsibilities, such as pinning, posting news</p>
	<li><p>Organizing Group Voting</p>
	<li><p>Deleting inappropriate posts on the spot</p>
	<li><p>Summoning the Keepers</p>
</ul>
<p>If you have a problem with a Representatives, or any other discord
user, utilize mod mail by DM-ing: 
</p>
<p><font face="Mono">!MODMAIL_KEEPERS&#128238;#0864 </font>
</p>
<p>Your Active Representatives are <font face="Mono">pigeons#2351</font>,

<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Our four channels are:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><b>#&#128240;the-daily-spews
	</b></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">a news/announcement
	board channel</font></p>
	<li><p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><b>#orb-corner </b></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">or

	<li><p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><b>#gleek-seating</b></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">

	<li><p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><b>#moist-glallery</b></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">
	an archival art channel</font></p>
</ul>
<h1 class="western">#&#128240;The-Daily-Spews</h1>
<p>Our news channel. Make sure to read to keep up with current events
&amp; team organization.</p>
<h3 class="western">Temperature Checks</h3>
<p>Sometimes the representatives will do quick temperature checks in
<b>#the-daily-spews</b> to get a feel for general team vibes on a
topic. Results of temperature checks are not set in stone, but they
help representatives make snap decisions, such as e.g. temporarily
closing our channels after a player is incinerated.</p>
<h1 class="western">#Moist-Glallery</h1>
<p>A channel dedicated to art &amp; creative content only.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Post Creative content <b>#moisttalkers-glallery</b>. Don't be
	afraid to post it in the main channel as well, this channel exist
	for Archival purposes. Tag your art so people can search the channel
	more easily, e.g. [Richmond] or [Ziwa &amp; Eugenia].</p>
	<li><p>No chatter in <b>#moisttalkers-glallery</b>, the other we
	have two other channels for people talking moistly. Artists, feel
	free to post art in <b>#moisttalkers-glallery</b> &amp; the main
	channel so people can gush over it there. Incidental chatter will be
	deleted by the representatives.</p>
	<li><p>WIPs &amp; Sketches live in <b>#moisttalkers-glallery</b>
	too! Please post your sketches you might not necessarily be
	confident to post in <b>#fanwork </b>in <b>#moisttalkers-glallery</b>,
	we think they are beautiful and still want to see them. However try
	to refrain from spamming WIPs, if you want show us every step of the
	process maybe make a process GIF/video!</p>
</ul>
<h1 class="western"><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Pausing
Topics</b></font></font> &#9208;</h1>
<p>&#128679;<i>[Under construction]</i>&#128679;<br/>
Sometimes the
team representatives will ask for moratorium or &ldquo;pause&rdquo;
on certain topics. Usually this is when something catastrophic has
happened to the team and we can&rsquo;t deal with voting discourse &amp;
incineration grief happening simultaneously.</p>
<h1 class="western">Voting</h1>
<p>Every team has a slightly different approach to organised voting.
Ours can be summarized as &ldquo;curated democracy&rdquo;. We
encourage people to vote with their hearts, as long as they <i><span style="font-weight: normal">record
their votes in the sheet </span></i><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">&#128065;&#9997;<br/>
</span></span><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">If
a conversation about voting becomes too circular or heated, the
representatives will shut it down.</span></span></p>
<h2 class="western">The Sheet</h2>
<p>All our voting is recorded &amp; coordinated in a google sheet.
You can find the sheet by posting <font face="Mono">+moistvotes</font>
in <b>#orb-corner</b>. One of the most important parts of the sheet
is the <i>blessing/decrees preference</i> section. It gives everyone
a chance to voice their opinions without the topic of voting
dominating chat.</p>
<h3 class="western">Curated Democracy</h3>
<p>If there is a clear leader in the <i>blessing/decrees preference</i>
section, we&rsquo;ll begin propaganda for that option so we can
communicate to the discord-external community (usually via twitter).
Otherwise, representatives will use the general consensus from 
<i>blessing/decrees preference </i><span style="font-style: normal">section
to set </span><span style="font-style: normal">voting goals on the
</span><i>Blessing Vote Entry</i><span style="font-style: normal">
page. There </span><span style="font-style: normal">members</span><span style="font-style: normal">
who wish to engage in team coordination can find out where to vote.
Even if you don&rsquo;t vote for a voting goal, please record your
votes.</span></p>
<h2 class="western">Wills<!-- We should probably figure out how weâ€™re going to handle will discussion going forward --></h2>
<p>So far our current system has worked well, up until Season 12
where Wills were introduced.  Wills are far more divisive &amp;
higher permutation than blessings &amp; decrees. Our main rule for
Wills is <u><b>DON&rsquo;T VOTE UNTIL SATURDAY.</b></u> Voting before
Saturday can lead to cases of accidental necromancy, or infusing a
player now no longer on our team. Wills are only &ldquo;safe&rdquo;
to vote on after post-season has ended, when players can no longer be
affected by events. 
</p>
<p>The team representatives are still figuring out how to handle
Wills-course, please bear with us.</p>
<h1 class="western">Content Warnings &amp; Cursed Content</h1>
<p>You can spoiler text by with the  following formatting:<br/>
<font face="Mono">||
</font>Spoiler Text <font face="Mono">||</font><br/>
If you are on
mobile, the Blaseball Discord has a bot that lets you spoiler images
by starting your message with: <br/>
<font face="Mono">-spoiler</font></p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Make sure to spoiler text &amp;
images appropriately, and always let people know what you are issuing
a warning about. For example: <font face="Mono">cw: eyes</font></font></p>
<h2 class="western">Cursed Content</h2>
<p>Moist Talkers have a reputation for being into cursed content.
Here's some guidelines so cursed content can be a safe time for
everyone.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Cursed Content that has body horror &amp; hyper fixation on
	specific body parts should be spoilered, and have an appropriate
	Content Warning applied.</p>
	<li><p>No violent or gorey imagery.</p>
	<li><p>Nothing NSFW/NSFL, this is a PG-13 server.</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">Food Crimes</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal">Moist Talkers are the #1
exporter of food crimes, until the Wild Wings Legal Dept. sues us for
this claim. </span>If you ever need a refresher on food crime rules,
or how to spoiler things in general, use the <font face="Mono">+foodcrimes</font>
command in chat.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Spoiler your images of food in general, and let people know
	there's food content underneath with a Content Warning. Either <font face="Mono">cw:
	food</font> or <font face="Mono">cw: food crime</font></p>
	<li><p>Food crimes that are food being mixed, combined or used in
	unconventional ways? good &#9989;</p>
	<li><p>Food crimes that are unhygienic, off or spoiled, has
	something growing on it? bad &#128683;</p>
</ul>
<h1 class="western">Propaganda</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">Propaganda
is images related to voting, teams &amp; events posted in
</span><font face="Mono"><span style="font-style: normal">#community-billboard</span></font><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><u><b>DO NOT</b></u>
	appropriate IRL facist/bigoted propaganda/imagery for your
	propaganda.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">If your
	propaganda involves another team, get a temperature check from
	others in our channel if it seems appropriate.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">If you use
	another person&rsquo;s art in your propaganda, make sure to credit
	the artist.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">If your
	propaganda is a direct edit of another person&rsquo;s work ask that
	person for permission before posting.</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western">Misc.</h1>
<h2 class="western">Pronouns</h2>
<p>You are not obliged to put your pronouns in your name, but it
makes discord a more welcoming space for those who require to do so.</p>
<h2 class="western">Visitors</h2>

by default is </font><font face="Mono">Open</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">&#9989;.

<h2 class="western">Sundaes&#127848;</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Sundaes are a legit way to play the game that is Blaseball.
	Don&rsquo;t criticize/moralize other team members for using them.</p>
	<li><p>Conversely, do not do a song &amp; dance about your payouts
	for Sundaes. Remember, Be Kind.</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">Swoomba</h2>
<p>The Swoomba is a bot that deletes swear words. We have a couple of
extra words that it considers &ldquo;naughty words&rdquo; in our
channel. If your message gets randomly deleted for mentioning a
certain webcomic, that&rsquo;s why.</p>
