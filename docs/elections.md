# Election advice

Blaseball is complicated. Elections can have effects that are not at all obvious. Here are some of the more subtle things you might want to consider when voting.

Some of this advice refers to player attributes, which can be seen on the site with an Apple. An Apple will also let you see what percent of our Will votes are for each Will when you select the Will and open the voting dialog for it. Alternately, [SIBR](https://sibr.dev) has made tools that will let you view player attributes and Will vote standings without an Apple, though if you aren't careful around SIBR's stuff you may also see spoilers.

## Stars lie

There are players with few stars who are actually quite good, and players with lots of stars who aren't that great. Better ways to learn how good a player is include looking at their record on Blaseball Reference, looking at their hidden player attributes, and asking in Discord.

### Examples

#### Betsy Trombone

Betsy Trombone had three stars in pitching in season 14. She also had the second highest strike percentage in the league.
Beck Whitney

In season 14, Beck Whitney had six stars in batting and a batting average of 0.234. For comparison, her teammate Francisca Sasquatch had four batting stars and a batting average of 0.304.

## Rerolls are very risky

The stats of randomized or alternated players are generally similar to those of newly-hatched players. All our players are already better than most newly-hatched players.

### Examples

#### Wyatt Glover

Wyatt Glover has been randomized four times. None of those randomizations made them any better.

#### James Mora

In the season 7 elections, James Mora was rerolled 3 times, and gained only half a star in pitching.

## Plunder is very risky

Most of our players are quite good, so when plunder sends back a random player it's likely to lose us a good player. Also plunder can interact with player statuses like [REDACTED] in weird ways.

### Examples

#### York Silk, season 14

The Crabs plundered York and lost Enid Marlow.

Enid had slightly fewer batting stars, slightly more defense stars, and substantially more baserunning stars. Strategically, Enid was better for their team.

Also York was dead when he was plundered, so he got the Returned mod, which could return him to the Hall of Flames at the end of any season.

#### Chorby Short and Nagomi Mcdaniels, season 15

Plundering these [REDACTED] players didn't work, but it did give them the Unstable mod, which makes it much more likely that they won't survive the [REDACTED] plot arc.

#### Sutton Picklestein, season 13

The Flowers plundered Picklestein from the Hall of Flames in the season 13 election. This gave Picklestein the Returned mod, which dragged them back into the hall nine seconds later.

#### York Silk, season 15

We plundered York Silk and lost Fish Summer.

On the strategy side, York is worse than Fish at batting and baserunning, and about the same at defense. York has 4.7 batting stars, 1.1 baserunning stars, and 2.2 defense stars. Fish has 5.4 batting stars, 3.4 baserunning stars, and 2.1 defense stars.

Also, York still has the Returned mod, which means he may randomly go back to the hall at the end of any season.

In terms of lore, the Talkers watched York die, it is going to be weird for them to have to deal with zombie York who marks players for redaction. Also the Crabs were doing some neat York lore, and it would have been fun to see what they'd have done given more time.

Also Fish was great. They're a shark-headed thembo who bites the bottom half off their jerseys. We liked Fish a lot. We will miss them.

## Early voting is very risky

Blaseball is dangerous. Players who seem like good targets early in the week could be much worse, much better, on a different team, or incinerated by the end of the week.

If you need to vote early for logistics reasons, things that help the whole team are generally safer. For example, the High Pressure blessing in season 13 gave us a permanent boost that's tied to the team rather than to players.

### Examples

#### Joshua Butt

Joshua Butt was incinerated by a rogue umpire on day 77 of season 12. In the season 12 election, they were infused.

#### Nagomi Mcdaniel

Nagomi Mcdaniel was plundered by the Boston Flowers in the season 15 election. 4% of their Will votes were for plundering her.

Very late in the season, Nagomi was attacked by Consumers repeatedly, reducing her stats and eventually causing her to be [REDACTED].

It seems likely that the plunder votes were submitted early, since she looked like a much safer plunder target early in the week.

## Wills can clash

Often, two different Wills or blessing can affect the same player. Combining them in unplanned ways can lead to bad results.

Checking in on the discord's plans can help you avoid clashing with a big group of voters. And if you join the discord election planning discussions and polls, you can help shape those discord plans.

### Examples

#### Ohio Worms, season 15

In season 15, many Ohio Worms fans organized to trade Luis Acevedo for Crabs pitcher Jacoby Podcast. This won with 27% of the Worms' Will votes.

A few Worms fans voted to Infuse Luis Acevedo's pitching. This won with 0% of the Worms' Will votes.

Acevedo was improved by the transfuse, but the improvement didn't benefit the Worms at all, since Acevedo had just been sent to the Crabs.

#### Boston Flowers, season 12

In season 12, a few Boston Flowers fans voted to swap Alaynabella Hollywood with shadows player Zesty Yaboi using the Foreshadow Will. This succeeded with 1% of the Flowers' Will votes.

Other Flowers fans voted to swap Alaynabella Hollywood with then-Garages player Nagomi Mcdaniel using the Exchange Will. This succeeded with 0% of the Flowers' Will votes.

The combination of these two Wills left Nagomi, a much better batter than either Alaynabella or Zesty, in the Flowers' shadows rather than on their lineup.
