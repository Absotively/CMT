# Super Secret Election Stuff

_Note: Please don't share this page outside the Moist Talkers Discord channels!_

_We know this isn't **that** hard to find, but neither is the stuff that's actually in the channel. Some of the resources here are really meant to accompany discussions on Discord and we'd like to keep them in that context._

Our current approach to election discussions is to analyze our options based on [talking spit and getting hits]({% link spit-hits.md %}).

Our [election and strategy guide]({% link elections.md %}) explains some of the less obvious things we consider, especially on the getting hits front.

We hold strategy discussions in our watch channel, #âšªthe-underarena. Remember that people asking about strategy early in the week may be trying to start a discussion, and avoid jumping to "No votes until Saturday" as a response.

The [proposal doc](http://moist.fans/proposals.html) is where we're tracking things people have proposed for the upcoming election and the major points that have been made for or against each proposal.

Later in the week there is usually at least one poll. Probably best to ask about that in the Discord, in case we forgot to update this with the current link.

The [voting guide]({% link voting.md %}) has a summary of what we've already come to a consensus on. Early in the week, it usually just recommends a few safe blessings for early voters. Some time on Friday or Saturday it will get updated with the results of the week's election discussions.

The [vote tracking form](http://moist.fans/form.html) is where you can record what you vote for so we can see how many of our votes are from people who follow this stuff on Discord.

You can see the data from the vote tracking form on the [vote tracking sheet](http://moist.fans/tracker.html). Be warned that this does contain a little bit of forbidden knowledge - it shows the Will vote percentages that can be seen on the site with an Apple.
