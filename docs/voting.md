# Moist Talkers S17 Election Plans

## Wills

### Move Carmelo Plums to either the Shadows or the Rotation

If Plums joins the rotation, they may be faxed, but the rotation will stay bigger. And we'll get to see Carmelo pitch.

We can't win the same Will twice, so these don't conflict. Pick either one!

### Transfuse Batting for Jesús Koch or Ziwa Mueller

Either of them could use a little boost! Just like with the two Move options, we can only win Transfuse once, so having some votes for both Jesús and Ziwa doesn't raise the risk of Plums getting left in the lineup.

## Blessings

If we get the Jersey Supply Run, none of our players will have an available slot for the handcrafted or crate items. But we might not get the jerseys!

### Primary focuses

 * Jersey Supply Run
 * Last Not Least
 * Slime Crate Drop

### Secondary focuses

 * Buddies
 * Any Crate
 * Any Handcrafted item

## Decrees

They all seem fine, vote for any of them!
