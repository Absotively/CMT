# Voting Guide


## Blessings

 * **Moderation**
 * **Headliners**

Want to spread your votes a little more? Most of the blessings are pretty good for us this season, **except** Now Hiring, Super Roamin' Fifth Base, Fax Preparation, and Hits Keep Coming. **Please avoid those four!**

## Wills

Please focus more on blessings this season! We've got our fingers crossed for some early Alt Trust Amos votes.

 * Infuse London Simmons' Batting
 * Foreshadow Augusto Reddick for London Simmons

## Decrees

Vote with your heart!
