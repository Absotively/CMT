# Voting Guide

It's helpful to wait for Saturday if you can, but if you're voting early, here are some options to consider.

## Safe Early Voting Options

* Outdoorsy
* Gaudy
* Cluttered
* Batting Practice
* Pitching Practice
* Running Practice
* Defense Practice
* Shadow of the Bats
* Fax Numbers
* Shadow Run
* Cover Letters
* Junk Baller
* Walk It Off
* Feast or Famine
* Revelations
* Shadow Sunglasses Supply Run
* Shadow Helmet Supply Run
* Targeted Evolution

## Riskier Early Voting Options

These are definitely risky, because Super Roamin' might make a player leave and Amos might be feedbacked to some other team by election time, but if you're determined to take risks with your early vote these are probably the ones to take:

* Super Roamin' Fifth Base
* Alternate Trust Will targeting Amos Melon
