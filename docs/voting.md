# Moist Talkers S17 Voting Guide

These are the things that Discord thinks would be good. They're just suggestions; you can always vote with your heart instead if none of these sound good to you!

If you want to ask us to explain in more detail, or if you'd like to have input in future voting guides, then come [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/3uFgJhu). Follow the instructions in the #choose-your-team channel when you get there.

## Wills

### Move Carmelo Plums to either the Shadows or the Rotation

If Plums joins the rotation, they may be faxed, but the rotation will stay bigger. And we'll get to see Carmelo pitch.

We can't win the same Will twice, so these don't conflict. Pick either one!

### Transfuse Batting for Jesús Koch or Ziwa Mueller

Either of them could use a little boost! Just like with the two Move options, we can only win Transfuse once, so having some votes for both Jesús and Ziwa doesn't raise the risk of Plums getting left in the lineup.

## Blessings

If we get the Jersey Supply Run, none of our players will have an available slot for the handcrafted or crate items. But we might not get the jerseys!

### Primary focuses

 * Jersey Supply Run
 * Last Not Least
 * Slime Crate Drop

### Secondary focuses

 * Buddies
 * Any Crate
 * Any Handcrafted item

## Decrees

They all seem fine, vote with your heart!

If you don't have a favourite, consider Smithy. Items are generally pretty good, it'd be nice if they lasted longer.
